Workaround for Windows 10 slideshow
I want to see the Artist, Title, and Date of each piece of artwork

Program will compare a source and destination folder of images
Any image in the source and not in the destination will be processed
Processing means saving a copy of the picture with a bar of text added with Artist/Title/Date info
This info will be pulled from the filename based on a configured format
Will keep the format abstract - just a series of fields, not specifically artist/title/date

configuration
	source folder
	destination folder
	regex for filename - break it into fields
	regex for added text - bring the fields back together

FileNameRegex is normal Regex format
	make sure all fields are surrounded by capturing ( ) parentheses
	
DisplayTextFormat
	each \digit will be replaced by the corresponding match from the Regex
	ex: "Artist: \1, Title: \2" becomes "Artist: da Vinci, Title: The Mona Lisa"
	
	only workds for single digit values
