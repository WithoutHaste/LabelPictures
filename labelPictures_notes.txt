Workaround for Windows 10 slideshow
I want to see the Artist, Title, and Date of each piece of artwork

Program will compare a source and destination folder of images
Any image in the source and not in the destination will be processed
Processing means saving a copy of the picture with a bar of text added with Artist/Title/Date info
This info will be pulled from the filename based on a configured format
Will keep the format abstract - just a series of fields, not specifically artist/title/date

configuration
	source folder
	destination folder
	regex for filename - break it into fields
	regex for added text - bring the fields back together

FileNameDelimiter
	one character to split the filename into fields on
	".extension" will not be included
	
DisplayTextFormat
	each \digit will be replaced by the corresponding match from the Regex
	ex: "Artist: \1, Title: \2" becomes "Artist: da Vinci, Title: The Mona Lisa"
	
	only works for single digit values
	
	accepts multiple DisplayTextFormat settings, as DisplayTextFormat1, DisplayTextFormat2, etc
	the first one with the correct number of \digit will be used
